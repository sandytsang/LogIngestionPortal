# Log Ingestion Portal

Collect Windows device telemetry with **Intune Proactive Remediations** and send it
to a **custom Log Analytics table** via the **Logs Ingestion API** — no agents, no
third‑party services. Pick the data you want in a browser, download the matching
artifacts, and deploy with one command.

**▶ Use the portal:** https://sandytsang.github.io/LogIngestionPortal/

> Runs entirely in your browser — no sign‑in, no backend, nothing leaves your machine.

The repo has two parts:

| Folder | What it is |
| --- | --- |
| [`LogIngestionPortalWebPortal/`](LogIngestionPortalWebPortal) | A static, 100% client‑side web portal that generates `columns.json`, the Intune detection script, and a deploy README. Runs entirely in your browser — no backend, nothing leaves your machine. |
| [`LogIngestionAPI/`](LogIngestionAPI) | The Azure solution: Bicep infrastructure (Log Analytics workspace, custom table, Data Collection Rule, PowerShell Function App) plus the deploy script and the device remediation script. |

## How it works

```mermaid

  A[Portal: pick data points] --> B[columns.json + remediate.ps1]
  B --> C[deploy.ps1]
  C --> D[Function App + DCR + LA table]
  E[Intune Proactive Remediation<br/>runs remediate.ps1 as SYSTEM] -->|device-signed JWT| D
  D --> F[(DeviceInventory_CL)]
```

1. **Pick** the device properties in the portal and download the bundle.
2. **Deploy** the infrastructure with `LogIngestionAPI/scripts/deploy.ps1` (it
   builds the table + DCR from `columns.json` and publishes the Function code).
3. **Upload** `remediate.ps1` as an Intune Proactive Remediation **detection**
   script. Devices collect the data and POST it to the Function, which forwards it
   to the DCR and into your Log Analytics table.

Every request is authenticated with a **device‑signed JWT** (proof of possession
of the device's Entra‑join certificate) — this is always required.

## Quick start

**1. Generate artifacts** — just open the hosted portal in your browser:

**▶ https://sandytsang.github.io/LogIngestionPortal/**

Pick your data points, set the table/config, then click **Download all (.zip)** —
you get `columns.json`, `remediate.ps1`, and a `README.txt` with the exact deploy
command. Nothing to install for this step.

> Prefer to run the portal locally instead of using the hosted page? See
> [Run the portal locally](#run-the-portal-locally-optional) below — that's the
> only part that needs Node.js/npm.

**2. Deploy** — from `LogIngestionAPI` (after dropping in your `columns.json`):

```powershell
cd LogIngestionAPI
./scripts/deploy.ps1 -FunctionResourceGroup rg-loging-dev -Location eastus
```

**3. Wire up Intune** — set `$FunctionUrl` in `remediate.ps1` to the URL the deploy
prints (including `?code=<key>`), then upload it as a Proactive Remediation
detection script.

See [`LogIngestionAPI/README.md`](LogIngestionAPI/README.md) for full deploy options
(existing workspace, Consumption vs Flex plan, dev/test/prod, schema‑only updates,
and the Microsoft Graph `Device.Read.All` permission the device check needs).

## Prerequisites

To **deploy** (steps 2–3) you need:

- **PowerShell 7+**, **Azure CLI** (`az login`), **Azure Functions Core Tools v4**
- An Azure subscription with rights to create resources and role assignments

Using the hosted portal (step 1) needs nothing but a browser. **Node.js is only
required if you choose to run the portal locally** (below).

## Run the portal locally (optional)

Most people can skip this and use the hosted portal. Run it locally only if you
want to develop it or run offline:

```powershell
cd LogIngestionPortalWebPortal
npm install
npm run dev        # then open the printed localhost URL
```

## Updating what you collect

- **Change columns:** re‑pick in the portal, replace `columns.json`, and run the
  portal's **“Update data columns only”** command (`deploy.ps1 -SchemaOnly`) — the
  Function App is left untouched.
- **Add a property the catalog doesn't have:** edit `remediate.ps1`, run it with
  `-PreviewData` to capture the JSON, then use the portal's **“Build columns.json
  from data”** tool to generate a matching schema.

## Contributing

New data points are community‑driven via small JSON entries — no app code changes.
See [`LogIngestionPortalWebPortal/CONTRIBUTING.md`](LogIngestionPortalWebPortal/CONTRIBUTING.md).
Collectors must be **read‑only**; this is enforced automatically in CI.
